## Variables description

The data in this project comes from two data sources:
- data on air pollution: https://aqicn.org/data-platform/covid19/
- data on weather conditions: https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api

The data was collected for diffrent european cities. While selecting data for specific city one dataframe is formed, which contains information from both data sources. Below are described variables present in the starting dataframe (after city slection) with the division for two datasources.
